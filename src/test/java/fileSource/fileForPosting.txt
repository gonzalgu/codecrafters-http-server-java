Since you've been programming in C++ for such a long time, I would like to hear your take on all the changes
that the language has undergone. I've programmed in C++ for some time, around the time when C++11 was new (I've switched to Java
since), but every once in a while I take a look at what's new in the C++ world. I feels like a completely different
language sometimes. Anyway, I've like to hear your take on what the modern C++ curriculum should look like, for someone who is already
a professional programmer.
